As well as collaborating with researchers from throughout the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, we are also working to develop several tools that we have developed to release these for use by the wider bioinformatics community. These tools will be made available via the University of Portsmouth [GitHub](https://github.com/uopbioinformatics) account, as well as directly from the University of Portsmouth [Bioinformatics Group website](../../software/index.html).
