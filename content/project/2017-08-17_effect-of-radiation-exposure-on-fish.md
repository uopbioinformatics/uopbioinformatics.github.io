Exposure to radiation can have deleterious effects on gene expression regulation, particularly due to increased DNA damage and deregulation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Working together with Dr. Adelaide Lerebours, we are performing differential expression analyses to understand the effects of radiation on 3-spined stickleback under laboratory conditions, and in particular attempting to characterise the differences between normal and abnormal offspring of exposed parents to understand how mutations are passed down through the lineage. In addition, we are looking at the effects of radiation exposure in the field, by looking at the effects of radiation exposure on lakes around the Chernobyl nuclear power station which suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986. The effects of this are still being felt today, and this project will allow us to understand the negative impact that this disaster has had on aquatic life in the area.
