The variant histones H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z2 are distinct but highly homologous genes. As yet, functional differences between these two variants have not been elucidated. However, recent work by researchers at the university of Portsmouth have identified distinct roles for these two proteins in early development.

Together with [Professor Matt Guille](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/prof-matt-guille.html) and [Dr. Fiona Myers](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-fiona-myers.html), we are examining the differential role of these highly similar but distinct proteins during the development of Xenopus laevis at the transcriptional level.
