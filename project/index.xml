      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Enzyme Innovation is a new initiative set up at the University of Portsmouth, with a goal to find solutions to some of the most pressing global environmental problems. In particular, we aim to examine environmental samples to find how the natural world has solved the problem of plastic pollution, by identifying microorganisms who have evolved to be able to break down plastics in the environment. By identifying these microorgansisms, and further understanding the enzymatic methods that they use towards this goal, we aim to harness the amazing work that nature has done, and find ways to enhance this and scale it up on an industrial scale to allow their use in circular recycling of plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.port.ac.uk/enquire/news/portsmouth-scientists-awarded-major-plastics-funding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recently awarded £5.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding from the Research England Expanding Excellence Fund. Together with significant investment from the University of Portsmouth, we aim to use this funding to speed up our progress towards finding a solution to one of the world’s greatest environmental challenges – plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working in the Discovery phase of the pipeline, aiming to use next generation &lt;a href=&#34;https://nanoporetech.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nanopore&lt;/a&gt; sequencing to explore microorganisms present on samples taken from environmental sites of interest (e.g. plastic receycling centres) to try and profile what is present and how they have developed to survive on plastic substrates. We aim to use this bioprospecting approach to explore metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of samples to identify mechanisms of action for plastic degaradation, and in particular to compare with previously explored species to identify what makes these species unique. This information, and information on the make-up of enzymes involved in the processes, will feed through the pipeline to be further engineered to create enzymes that can be scaled up on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Portsmouth Heritage Hub</title>
      <link>/project/2019-06-18_portsmouth_heritage_hub/</link>

      <guid>/project/2019-06-18_portsmouth_heritage_hub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Portsmouth Heritage Hub was set up by Dr Sam Robson, Dr Robert Inkpen and Dr Garry Scarlett, and aims to provide a centralised hub for researchers within the University of Portsmouth currently working on projects involving preservation, conservation, interpretation and education about our local cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Solent, and the surrounding Wessex area has a rich array of history. Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard, home to world famous ships such as the Mary Rose and HMS Victory, attracts thousands of visitors from around the world, and provides a window into the life of sailors throughout the ages and how this has shaped the City today. The Isle of Wight has proved to be one of the richest sources of dinosaur fossils in all of Europe,  and has earned it the title of the UK’s Dinosaur Capital. Fishbourne Roman. Palace in Chichester is the largest Roman residential building to have been discovered in Britain, and offers a unique glimpse into the life of  Britons following the Roman conquest. And of course, Portsmouth will today play host to Royalty and international leaders to celebrate its part in the D-Day landings in Normandy, one of the most important operations in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills and expertise of researchers throughout the University are multifaceted and span a wide range of themes and fields. These include (but are not limited to) expertise with ancient DNA analysis to understand our past, identifying novel ways to preserve monuments and buildings, interpretation of ancient texts and oral histories, and using modern technology such as virtual reality to provide interactive ways to engage the public with their past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more projects besides, and our aim is to provide a framework for these researchers to work together with local stakeholders in historical monuments, buildings and other sites to identify ways to improve the heritage of our local area, to interpret our history to better inform our understanding of our past, and to provide new and interesting ways to engage the local area with our history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes in microbial communities of Cliona celeta during observed changes in sponge health</title>
      <link>/project/2017-09-29_microbial_community_of_cliona_celeta_during_observed_changes_in_sponge_health/</link>

      <guid>/project/2017-09-29_microbial_community_of_cliona_celeta_during_observed_changes_in_sponge_health/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cliona celeta is a yellow boring sponge found around the waters of the UK. The diversity of sponges in the Skomer Marine Nature Reserve has been surveyed since the 1990s. In 2013 divers observed apparent disease in C. celeta individuals across Skomer Island and the Marloes Peninsula. The previously healthy yellow sponge became colonised by fouling organisms followed by tissue decay and patches of black necrotic sponge. This issue appears to be seasonal, largely seen between the months of March and October, and is the first recorded incidence of sponge disease in temperate coastal waters. In addition, several sponges were seen to be fouled by algal and invertebrate species, without progression to the black state, which is indicative of reduced anti-fouling mechanisms in the sponge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-joanne-preston.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Joanne Preston&lt;/a&gt;, we are working to identify the change in microbial communities following the shift between healthy and fouled or necrotic tissue in sponges based on microbiological culturing and 16S rDNA sequencing of the sponge host and the microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genotyping of Ancient DNA from Crew Members from the Mary Rose</title>
      <link>/project/2017-09-29_genotyping_of_crew_members_of_the_mary_rose/</link>

      <guid>/project/2017-09-29_genotyping_of_crew_members_of_the_mary_rose/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Built in Portsmouth in 1510, the Mary Rose was the flagship of the fleet of Henry VIII, and had a long and lustrious career until it capsized north of the Isle of Wight in the Battle of the Solent in 1545. Fewer than 35 of the roughly 400 crew members escaped. The wreck was discovered in 1971, and following years of excavation activities the hull was raised from the seabed in 1982 and transported to its home port of Portsmouth. Since then, years of archaeological work has been carried out on the hull itself and on the nearly 20,000 artefacts that have so far been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-garry-scarlett.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Garry Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Portsmouth, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maryrose.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mary Rose Museum&lt;/a&gt;, we will be looking to understand more about the members of the crew by working on genotyping of the ancient DNA from the skeletons of crew members raised from the wreckage. Using whole genome sequencing techniques, we hope to develop an understanding of phenotypic characteristics, disease traits and geographic information of crew members of one of the most famous ship wrecks in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_development-of-bioinformatics-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As well as collaborating with researchers from throughout the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, we are also working to develop several tools that we have developed to release these for use by the wider bioinformatics community. These tools will be made available via the University of Portsmouth &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/uopbioinformatics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account, as well as directly from the University of Portsmouth &lt;a href=&#34;../../software/index.html&#34;&gt;Bioinformatics Group website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Anti-Fouling Coatings on Marine Biofilms</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17_anti-fouling-marine-biofilms/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_anti-fouling-marine-biofilms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marine biofilms, or &amp;ldquo;biofouling&amp;rdquo;, are communities of micro-organisms bound together on a surface by an extracellular matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Biofilms consist predominantly of phytoplankton (particularly diatoms which are photosynthesising algae) and bacteria, which bind to surfaces in the marine environment to form complex 3 dimensional surface structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of these biofilms can affect all types of surfaces in the marine environment, and substrates include such man-made structures as the hulls of ships, nets used by fishing trawlers, pipelines used to transport oil and gas, and boat propellors. Biofilm formation on ships can have a costly impact due to increased drag - for example the increased cost of fuel has been estimated at around $56 million per year for DDG-51 naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, testing novel antifouling substrates that are environmentally benign is of great importance to many marine-based industries. Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/maria-salta.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Maria Salta&lt;/a&gt; we have been analysing the changes in bacterial communities on different man-made surfaces using next-generation sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Radiation Exposure in the Environment</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17_effect-of-radiation-exposure-on-fish/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_effect-of-radiation-exposure-on-fish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to radiation can have deleterious effects on gene expression regulation, particularly due to increased DNA damage and deregulation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Working together with Dr. Adelaide Lerebours, we are performing differential expression analyses to understand the effects of radiation on 3-spined stickleback under laboratory conditions, and in particular attempting to characterise the differences between normal and abnormal offspring of exposed parents to understand how mutations are passed down through the lineage. In addition, we are looking at the effects of radiation exposure in the field, by looking at the effects of radiation exposure on lakes around the Chernobyl nuclear power station which suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986. The effects of this are still being felt today, and this project will allow us to understand the negative impact that this disaster has had on aquatic life in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gene Expression Profiling of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17_expression-profiling-of-dmd/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_expression-profiling-of-dmd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive form of muscular dystrophy typically presenting in boys at around the age of four. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which is the largest gene in the genome with 79 exons encoding a range of dystrophin proteins. These proteins are expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and also in brain and other non-muscle tissues, where they have specific roles. Their absence due to DMD mutations causes specific abnormalities such as progressive muscle weakness and wasting and cognitive deficits. Muscle weakness begins in the upper legs and pelvis but quickly spreads until boys are unable to walk and eventually cannot breathe unaided.  As yet, no cure exists for DMD, despite it being the most common form of muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-pharmacy-and-biomedical-sciences/staff/prof-darek-gorecki.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Darek Gorecki&lt;/a&gt;, we are using RNA seq analysis to identify the changes in expression associated with a point mutation in the Dmd gene in a dystrophic mouse model. By identifying the pathways most impacted by the dystrophic phenotype, we hope to identify novel areas for future therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Role of Variant Histones in Xenopus Development</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17_role-of-variant-histones-on-xenopus-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_role-of-variant-histones-on-xenopus-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The variant histones H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z2 are distinct but highly homologous genes. As yet, functional differences between these two variants have not been elucidated. However, recent work by researchers at the university of Portsmouth have identified distinct roles for these two proteins in early development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/prof-matt-guille.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Matt Guille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-fiona-myers.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Fiona Myers&lt;/a&gt;, we are examining the differential role of these highly similar but distinct proteins during the development of Xenopus laevis at the transcriptional level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome Profiling Of The Radula of Patella vulgata</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17_transcriptome-profiling-of-common-limpet/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17_transcriptome-profiling-of-common-limpet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The radula is a long chitinous ribbon-like proboscus containing many tiny teeth that is used by almost all molluscs for feeding. The radula is scraped across the surface to which the mollusc is attached to isolate food before it enters the esophagus. The teeth, or denticles, of the radula in the common limpet (&lt;em&gt;Patella vulgata&lt;/em&gt;) have been shown to have the highest tensile strength of any naturally occuring material, outperforming even the high strength of spider silk (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387522/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barber &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2015)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together with researchers at the University of Portsmouth including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-engineering/staff/professor-asa-barber.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Asa Barber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-pharmacy-and-biomedical-sciences/staff/prof-darek-gorecki.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Darek Gorecki&lt;/a&gt;, we are performing transcriptional profiling throughout the development of the radula to understand the gene pathways involved in the natural generation of this incredibly strong biomaterial.&lt;/p&gt;
