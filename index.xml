      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Enzyme Innovation is a new initiative set up at the University of Portsmouth, with a goal to find solutions to some of the most pressing global environmental problems. In particular, we aim to examine environmental samples to find how the natural world has solved the problem of plastic pollution, by identifying microorganisms who have evolved to be able to break down plastics in the environment. By identifying these microorgansisms, and further understanding the enzymatic methods that they use towards this goal, we aim to harness the amazing work that nature has done, and find ways to enhance this and scale it up on an industrial scale to allow their use in circular recycling of plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.port.ac.uk/enquire/news/portsmouth-scientists-awarded-major-plastics-funding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recently awarded £5.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding from the Research England Expanding Excellence Fund. Together with significant investment from the University of Portsmouth, we aim to use this funding to speed up our progress towards finding a solution to one of the world’s greatest environmental challenges – plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working in the Discovery phase of the pipeline, aiming to use next generation &lt;a href=&#34;https://nanoporetech.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nanopore&lt;/a&gt; sequencing to explore microorganisms present on samples taken from environmental sites of interest (e.g. plastic receycling centres) to try and profile what is present and how they have developed to survive on plastic substrates. We aim to use this bioprospecting approach to explore metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of samples to identify mechanisms of action for plastic degaradation, and in particular to compare with previously explored species to identify what makes these species unique. This information, and information on the make-up of enzymes involved in the processes, will feed through the pipeline to be further engineered to create enzymes that can be scaled up on an industrial scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Portsmouth Heritage Hub was set up by Dr Sam Robson, Dr Robert Inkpen and Dr Garry Scarlett, and aims to provide a centralised hub for researchers within the University of Portsmouth currently working on projects involving preservation, conservation, interpretation and education about our local cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Solent, and the surrounding Wessex area has a rich array of history. Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard, home to world famous ships such as the Mary Rose and HMS Victory, attracts thousands of visitors from around the world, and provides a window into the life of sailors throughout the ages and how this has shaped the City today. The Isle of Wight has proved to be one of the richest sources of dinosaur fossils in all of Europe,  and has earned it the title of the UK’s Dinosaur Capital. Fishbourne Roman. Palace in Chichester is the largest Roman residential building to have been discovered in Britain, and offers a unique glimpse into the life of  Britons following the Roman conquest. And of course, Portsmouth will today play host to Royalty and international leaders to celebrate its part in the D-Day landings in Normandy, one of the most important operations in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills and expertise of researchers throughout the University are multifaceted and span a wide range of themes and fields. These include (but are not limited to) expertise with ancient DNA analysis to understand our past, identifying novel ways to preserve monuments and buildings, interpretation of ancient texts and oral histories, and using modern technology such as virtual reality to provide interactive ways to engage the public with their past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more projects besides, and our aim is to provide a framework for these researchers to work together with local stakeholders in historical monuments, buildings and other sites to identify ways to improve the heritage of our local area, to interpret our history to better inform our understanding of our past, and to provide new and interesting ways to engage the local area with our history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Portsmouth Heritage Hub Inaugural Workshop</title>
      <link>/post/portsmouth-heritage-hub-inaugural-workshop/</link>

      <guid>/post/portsmouth-heritage-hub-inaugural-workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday 7th June, the Mary Rose Museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard hosted the inaugural meeting of the Portsmouth Heritage Hub (PHH). The workshop aimed to bring together around 30 researchers from the University of Portsmouth with interests and expertise in the heritage field, with members of 15 organisations associated with local historical artefacts, architecture and monuments in Portsmouth and the surrounding area. It was a fantastic opportunity to foster collaborative research networks between people with the skills and expertise to solve problems, with stakeholders in our history with problems to solve. The ultimate aim of the PHH is to enrich the community through preservation, conservation, interpretation and education about our rich and unique regional history &amp;ndash; from the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Period, through the maritime history of our island port city, to our place in history as the launch point for much of the D-Day Landing fleet in 1944, recently celebrated by World Leaders on the 75th Anniversary of this pivotal turning point to World War II. In this way, we can help to protect our heritage, understand how it has shaped our life today, and how it might inform our future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day began with an introduction from Prof. Leila Choukroune, Director of the University of Portsmouth Democratic Citizenship Theme, who kindly sponsored the event. She outlined the goals of the hub, and the need to develop close working relationships between the University and our surrounding community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of short talks followed, which highlighted the vast array of multidisciplinary work currently ongoing within the field. The talks were opened by Dr. Sam Robson, a researcher from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Science, who talked about how he and other researchers at the University have applied cutting edge genetic research to learn more about members of the Mary Rose crew, in a program of work recently highlighted in the Channel 4 documentary  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.channel4.com/programmes/skeletons-of-the-mary-rose-the-new-evidence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skeletons of the Mary Rose: The New Evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Dr. Joy Watts from the School of Biological Sciences talked about work that she has been conducting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/fishbourne-roman-palace&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fishbourne Roman Palace&lt;/a&gt;, looking at ways of understanding the effects of microorganisms growing on the ruins, and how these can be targeted to better preserve the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Madgwick, an osteological researcher from Cardiff University who has previously worked on projects with the Mary Rose Museum, talked about some recent work looking at methods of tracking the origin of early settlers through analysis of livestock remains. His work showed that feasts and rituals in Late Neolithic sites such as Stonehenge may have attracted attendees from as far away as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-47554926&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scotland, North East England and West Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Munt, Curator and General Manager of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dinosaurisle.com/newhomepage.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dinosaur Isle Museum on the Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt;, moved us away from the scientific to give us a fascinating overview of the Isle of Wight’s rich treasure trove of fossilized dinosaur remains. With over 30,000 specimens, the region is the richest dinosaur locality in Europe, and the museum works hard not only to engage in significant research projects with the University, but also to engage the public through guided tours along the shore line where many specimens were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Karl Bell, a researcher in the School of Social, Historical and literary Studies, next led a fascinating talk about his work on understanding the social and cultural context of Portsmouth and port towns across the globe, as unique sites of socio-cultural exchange. In particular, he gave an insight into his work on assembling and preserving local folklore and urban myth as a form of intangible heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Tarek Teba from Portsmouth School of Architecture gave an introduction to some of the many modern methods that he is currently using to create digital reconstructions of ruins as a way to bring context to visitors that may otherwise be missing when visiting the sites. The ability to explore long-dead civilisations in “game-ified” recreations offers a tangible way to interact with our past history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr Alexzandra Hildred, Head of research and Curator of Ordnance and Human Remains at the Mary Rose Trust, gave an incredibly revealing talk about the wealth of research projects undertaken by the trust. From developing ways to preserve the timbers of the ship that have led to the incredible museum exhibit that we see today, through using cutting edge technology to glean understanding from the many artefacts discovered, to using genetics, osteology and morphological analysis to understand who the men of the Mary Rose really were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following an incredibly incisive tour around the Mary Rose Museum, where the immense work conducted to preserve this 500 year old ship and its inhabitants can be seen, participants returned to take part in a series of workshops to help guide the direction of the PHH. The first workshop focussed on identifying key focus themes for members of the hub, to understand where the critical mass of our members might lie. The focus areas that were identified and discussed throughout the workshop were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heritage buildings and structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New ways of interpreting the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conserving and preserving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A changing Portsmouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we got here: How the past has influenced the present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreating the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heritage and the community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions were insightful and provide a huge amount of information to help us to develop the direction in which the hub should be headed. Much of the discussion is currently being digested to determine the next steps that we hope to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second workshop had a more focussed aim; to identify short term and long-term projects that might be easily developed into funding-generating projects able to capitalize on the networks that we had built up through the day. The session did not disappointment, and a number of incredibly exciting projects arose that instantly show the worth of collaborative events such as this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the future, we aim to maintain the momentum that the workshop has generated, and attract even more members to promote further cross-disciplinary working to help galvanise work within the heritage sphere. The first projects identified for short-term grant applications will be explored in more specific workshops, whilst in the meantime we will explore the incredibly exciting longer term goals that have come out from our work together. The outcome of the PHH working in partnership with local heritage stakeholders will be an improvement to maintenance of our local community history, helping to show the benefits and positive role that academic institutions can play in developing the local community. We look fo&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have written and implemented a pipeline for the analysis of NGS data from various sources (ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, 16S rDNA, &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; assembly, etc.) which I have been using in my analyses. It utilises a number of well documented and curated tools and tracks each step of the process using a centralised mysql database. I am currently working to make this portable as I believe that it may be of use to other researchers. Once this is complete, I will make the code available here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/welcome-to-the-university-of-portsmouth-bioinformatics-group-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the University of Portsmouth Bioinformatics Group website. I set up this group having recently moved from the University of Cambridge, and hope to develop the group further over the coming years. I am going to aim to post regularly on this blog with posts relating to data analysis, experimental design, advances in sequencing technology, and other related matters that may be of interest to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have kicked things off with a &lt;a href=&#34;../../resource/rtutorial/index.html&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for those of you that are interested in learning how to use the statistical programming language &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. This language is incredibly useful for anybody looking to perform any kind of statistical analysis, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bioconductor.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bioconductor&lt;/a&gt; packages offer countless extensions to the base functionality to allow you to work with data of any type that you might care to mention. If you are interested in data analysis, I thoroughly recommend checking it out, and if you find it useful or if you splot any issues please comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I have begun to build a list of commonly used &lt;a href=&#34;../../resource/bioinformaticstools/index.html&#34;&gt;bioinformatics tools&lt;/a&gt;, which may help other people to see which tools are currently available for a variety of different bioinformatics tasks. It is a work in progress, so please bear with me while I continue to populate it. I hope to keep this up to date as I discover new tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short time that I have been at the University of Portsmouth, I have had similar conversations with a number of researchers and so will focus on discussing some of these commonly occurring questions in my first few posts (e.g. sample size for experimental design, number of reads required for a sequencing experiment, where to sequence your data, differences between sequecning technologies, etc.). Some of these may then develop further into additional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;bioinformatics&amp;rdquo; can apply to a wide range of disciplines in the biological sciences, and the field lies at the interface between biology, statistics, mathematics and computer science. This lecture will give a brief insight into the importance of bioinformatics in the biological sciences, and in particular will focus on the rise of next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches for reading the sequences of large amounts of DNA and RNA molecules simultaneously. We will discuss varied uses for NGS technology, how the Illumina Sequencing by Synthesis platform works, some insight into data formats associated with NGS, and an introduction to some of the resources available to bioinformaticians. This session will be delivered by Dr. Sam Robson.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this page you will find a list of commercial and academic sequencing facilities that you may wish to consider when looking for sequencing solutions for your project. In cases where the facility have been used by a member of the faculty here at the University of Portsmouth, you will find links to the researchers with experience. I will attempt to collate some feedback from these researchers on this page over time, but if you have any further questions, please contact the researchers indicated directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company in South Korea who offer a number of different sequencing services, including whole genome, exome, transcriptome, and epigenome sequencing technologies. They offer sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000/2500, Ion Torrent PGM and Ion Torrent Proton sequencers. Their services include whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, RNA seq, epigenomics and &lt;strong&gt;de novo&lt;/strong&gt; assembly. They also offer library preparation and bioinformatics support if required. They offer a guarentee on sequence on coverage, although this results from pooling of samples across multiple lanes which may cause batch difficulties in downstream analyses. They are very quick to respond to emails and in our experience seem very keen to provide us with good quality data. Typically they seem to offer very competitive rates for sequencing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company based in Nottingham who seem to offer a very comprehensive catalogue of sequencing services, including RNA seq, ChIP seq, whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, targeted sequening and metagenomics. They offer DNA/RNA extraction, library preparation, and bioinformatics support if required. They offer Illumina MiSeq, Illumina HiSeq and Illumina NextSeq services. They are one of the leading providers of commercial sequencing in Europe. Data that we have recieved from them in the past has been of high quality, however we have had one case of lost data which is yet to be resolved in a satisfactory manner. Communication when requesting services and data generation are very fast, but communication when problems have arisen has been very poor.&lt;/p&gt;

They offer a guarentee on sequence on coverage, although this results from pooling of samples across multiple lanes which may cause batch difficulties in downstream analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a table that I have compiled based on the instruments available and the analyses that each facility is able to provide. Please note that I may have missed something - if I have made a mistake please let me know at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:samuel.robson@port.ac.uk&#34;&gt;samuel.robson@port.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly likely that any of these facilities would have the capacity to run whatever sequencing experiment you are hoping to conduct, but this table is based on the expertise highlighted on their websites:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes in microbial communities of Cliona celeta during observed changes in sponge health</title>

      <guid>/project/2017-09-29_microbial_community_of_cliona_celeta_during_observed_changes_in_sponge_health/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cliona celeta is a yellow boring sponge found around the waters of the UK. The diversity of sponges in the Skomer Marine Nature Reserve has been surveyed since the 1990s. In 2013 divers observed apparent disease in C. celeta individuals across Skomer Island and the Marloes Peninsula. The previously healthy yellow sponge became colonised by fouling organisms followed by tissue decay and patches of black necrotic sponge. This issue appears to be seasonal, largely seen between the months of March and October, and is the first recorded incidence of sponge disease in temperate coastal waters. In addition, several sponges were seen to be fouled by algal and invertebrate species, without progression to the black state, which is indicative of reduced anti-fouling mechanisms in the sponge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-joanne-preston.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Joanne Preston&lt;/a&gt;, we are working to identify the change in microbial communities following the shift between healthy and fouled or necrotic tissue in sponges based on microbiological culturing and 16S rDNA sequencing of the sponge host and the microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;
